- source_ref: main
- source_commit: 4a82ab779e8374035ca5e15f1cb1c0571395dc3d
- source_status: clean remote ref

- import_date: 2026-04-28
- exclusions: `.git/`; generated geoadmin runtime payloads such as `r2-seed-pipeline/src/shared/geoadmin/l0_countries/countries.geojson`, `r2-seed-pipeline/src/shared/geoadmin/l1_states/states_usa.geojson`, and runtime-parity outputs rebuilt under `data/my-farm-advisor/shared/geoadmin/{l0_countries,l1_states,l2_counties}/`; generated maturity report/table artifacts under `r2-seed-pipeline/src/shared/*/{reports,tables}/`; any repo-local CI or deployment files outside `skills/my-farm-advisor/`
- local_modifications: Imported `skills/my-farm-advisor/` into `my-farm-advisor/` and intentionally kept geoadmin source metadata JSON files while excluding generated geoadmin payloads. The committed metadata records the upstream `source_url`, `archive_name`, `output_geojson`, and `output_parquet` values used by `r2-seed-pipeline/src/scripts/ingest/download_geoadmin.py` to rebuild runtime outputs under `data/my-farm-advisor/shared/geoadmin/{l0_countries,l1_states,l2_counties}/`. Generated maturity report/table artifacts were also omitted while preserving `farm_dashboard.py`, `run_farm_pipeline.py`, and `run_maturity_by_fips.py`.
- update_procedure: Run `git ls-remote https://github.com/borealBytes/my-farm-advisor.git refs/heads/main`, confirm the SHA, clone or fetch the repo, copy only `skills/my-farm-advisor/` into `my-farm-advisor/`, preserve the geoadmin metadata JSON files, exclude generated geoadmin payloads and runtime copies that belong under `data/my-farm-advisor/shared/geoadmin/{l0_countries,l1_states,l2_counties}/`, exclude generated maturity report/table artifacts under `r2-seed-pipeline/src/shared/*/{reports,tables}/`, rerun `./scripts/validate.sh`, and refresh the QA evidence plus provenance fields in the same commit.
